# Decision-Tree
A simple walk through game inspired by the old myst games

This is a simple program that lets the user pick a character and then walk through a dream with that character. If user can walk thorugh the dream, pick up all the needed items, and not die, then they'll find their lost family member and exit the dream successfully. Otherwise, they may become lost in their dream. 

This was a re-interruption of a homework assignment from PSU's CS202, adding more functionality and an additional character.
